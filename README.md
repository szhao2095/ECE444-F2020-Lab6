### (2pt) Briefly Answer this question (~half page): What are the pros and cons of TDD?

Pros
- TDD forces good architecture since components must be modularized to be testable.
- Helps with debugging since desired functionality can be easily tested before each new update.
- The extra effort spent to write the test case can help the team better understand the project, and also to create documentation that would be useful
- It also forces you to write testable code.

Cons
- Guranteed to take more time to craft the test cases than to just write code for the feature.
- Changing the structure of the code requires changing the test cases as well, effectively making the project more time consuming to maintain.
- Possible to end up spending to much time writing and perfecting the test cases themselves instead of spending the time creating the actual features.
- Not necessarily easy to write and test certain features. 
- The whole team must be on board and willing to undertake the extra work of writing tests for their own sections.
